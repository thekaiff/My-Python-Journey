# Sometimes we want to play PUBG on our phone if the day is Sunday.
# Sometimes we order Ice Cream online if the day is sunny.
# Sometimes we go hiking if our parents allow.
# All these are decisions which depend on a condition being met.
# In python programming too, we must be able to execute instructions on a condition(s)
# being met.
# This is what conditionals are for!


# IF ELSE:
# if():  else:
